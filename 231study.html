                <h1>Pokemon Zodiac Website</h1> 
                <h3>Full Stack Development Study</h3>
                <p>An interactive web app that lets users discover their Pokémon zodiac through a calendar interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

            <h1 class="title">PROBLEM STATEMENT</h1>
            <p>The goal of the Pokémon Zodiac Website was to blend two popular themes: Pokémon and astrology. I combined these into a fun, interactive experience that engages fans of both. I wanted to make this project happen because I wanted to have fun with my class project in a playful, nostalgic way. The desired outcome was a responsive, visually appealing website that users could visit to discover their Pokémon Zodiac sign based on their birthdate, mirroring the style of traditional horoscopes but with a Pokémon twist.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="case_section">
            <h1 class="title">MY ROLE</h1>
            <p>This was a solo project, where I handled everything from initial concept and design to final code deployment. I created the wireframes and visual mockups using Figma, then developed the site with HTML and CSS. I was fully responsible for ideation, design, layout, and implementation. No collaboration was involved, which gave me full creative freedom but also required me to wear every hat from designer to developer.</p>

        <div class="case_section">
            <h1 class="title">TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
            <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, VS Code</p>
        </div>

        <div class="case_section">
            <h1 class="title">PROCESS</h1>
            <p>I knew I wanted to make this project about Pokémon the moment the prompt was given. As a longtime fan, I saw it as a fun opportunity to blend nostalgia with design thinking.
            <br><br>
            I started by mapping out how users would interact with the interface, focusing on simplicity, clarity, and a little bit of playfulness to match the theme. I did not feel the need to sketch out wireframes, as the design I had in mind was literally just a grid layout.
            <br><br>
            I used JavaScript to add interactive elements and made sure the UI was responsive across different screen sizes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="case_section">
            <h1 class="title">OUTCOME</h1>
            <p>The final product is a clean, user-friendly interface featuring 12 Pokémon icons, each representing a different Pokeball. Clicking on one brings up more information about the selected Pokémon along with some reasoning as to why a Pokemon relates to a certain Zodiac sign. The interface is simple and easy to navigate, meant for people to quickly have some fun.</p>
