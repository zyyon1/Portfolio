            <p class="intro-paragraph">I’m an undergraduate UX/UI student with a deep passion for intuitive design and seamless user experiences. I believe that great design isn’t just about making things look good; it’s about solving real problems. I’m driven by the simple yet powerful goal of making people’s lives easier. I want to learn, grow, and use my skills to help individuals and businesses streamline their processes, boost efficiency, and improve morale. Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript; plus modern libraries and frameworks. Passionate about responsive design and accesibility and a firm believer in the mobile-first approach. Successful in both team and self-directed settings.</p>

                    I’ve always been curious about how people interact with technology. Growing up, I loved solving puzzles, so when I was introduced to programming, it immediately clicked. I saw coding challenges as puzzles waiting to be solved, and that process felt incredibly rewarding. When I later discovered UI/UX, everything started to come together. I realized that great design isn’t just about aesthetics. It’s about how something works, how it makes someone feel, and how effortlessly it fits into their life. I want to create experiences that fit those criteria.

                    I’m from Philadelphia, PA, so choosing Drexel made a lot of sense. It’s local, which means I get to stay close to my family, but it also offers amazing opportunities through its co-op program. On top of that, I love being in a major city and everything that comes with it, from the energy and diversity to the constant inspiration that comes from being surrounded by new ideas and experiences.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of design and school, I’m really into video games. I’ve competed in Valorant at a high level, and more recently, I’ve gotten into League of Legends. It’s a whole new kind of challenge, and I’m enjoying diving into it. I also love exploring the city. I would consider myself to be pretty open minded, as I really enjoy trying new things. I think staying curious and open to new experiences helps me grow, both as a person and as a designer.
