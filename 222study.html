                <h1>Mock Doctor Website</h1> 
                <h3>Front-End Development Study</h3>
                <p>A responsive mock website for a doctor’s office, built using HTML and CSS with a focus on mobile-first design and media queries.</p>

            <h1 class="title">PROBLEM STATEMENT</h1>
            <p>The goal of the Mock Doctor Website was to simulate a professional healthcare site that felt trustworthy, easy to navigate, and responsive on all screen sizes. I wanted to challenge myself by building something more formal and content-heavy compared to past creative projects. The key objective was to strengthen my grasp of responsive design principles using a mobile-first approach and applying media queries effectively to adapt the layout for different devices.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="case_section">
            <h1 class="title">MY ROLE</h1>
            <p>This was a my first big project where I handled the full design and development process. I created the layout structure, chose a calming and accessible color palette, and coded the entire website from scratch using only HTML and CSS. This project was part of my coursework, but I treated it like a real-world scenario by focusing on user trust, clarity, and mobile usability. I made all design decisions and implemented the full responsive experience on my own.</p>

        <div class="case_section">
            <h1 class="title">TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
            <p>HTML, CSS, VS Code</p>
        </div>

        <div class="case_section">
            <h1 class="title">PROCESS</h1>
            <p>I started the project by thinking about the kind of content users would expect from a doctor’s website: clear service descriptions, contact information, and easy navigation. I structured the page content with semantic HTML, prioritizing accessibility and readability.
            <br><br>
            From the beginning, I approached it with a mobile-first mindset. I laid out the initial design for small screens, ensuring that spacing, text sizes, and images were optimized for mobile. After that, I used media queries to adjust the layout for tablets and desktop screens, adding features like side-by-side content sections, larger navigation bars, and increased padding for a more open desktop experience.
            <br><br>
            I didn’t use any frameworks or JavaScript. I only used well-structured CSS and thoughtful breakpoints to ensure everything adapted smoothly across screen sizes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="case_section">
            <h1 class="title">OUTCOME</h1>
            <p>The result is a clean, fully responsive mock healthcare website that looks and works great on phones, tablets, and desktops. It includes common features like a header with navigation, a services section, a contact area, and a simple footer. This project really solidified my understanding of mobile-first design and how to use media queries to create flexible, adaptable layouts without relying on heavy frameworks.</p>
